Files Needed: Public Use Micro Data Sample (PUMS) 
-	US Census housing-level and person-level survey data | Collected from WA residents during 2016


Data Used:
-	VALP (Property value data)
-	CIT (Citizenship Status)
1.	Born in the U.S.
2.	Born in Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or the Northern Marianas
3.	Born abroad of American parent(s)
4.	U.S. citizen by naturalization
5.	Not a citizen of the U.S.

# Analysis

Histogram of VALP:
- the majority of values lie between 0-500000 in USD
- this indicates that the majority of property values owned in the state of WA lie between those price vlaues

Box and Whiskers Plot of VALP against CIT:
- the relative medians across all 5 levels of citizenship status vary lightly
- the upper quartile range is the largest among levels 1, 3, 4, & 5
- among the 5 levels, level 4 (U.S. citizen by naturalization) have the highest overall median
- unsuprisingly CIT level 1 (Born in the U.S.) have the highest number of outlier values

Would be interesting to so how VALP values are distributed across the state of WA (most likely highest density in Seattle) and marital status of each survey respondent
